# Senior Angular Developer Assessment

This is Thackery Archuletta's submission for the Senior Angular Developer Assessment.

This project took me 10 hours and 9 minutes. To keep things close to the requested time limit, I'll halt progress here even though there are still some items that could done. The core requirements are done along with some of the optional requirements. I would list them here, but to keep the test requirements safe from public view, I'll refrain.

I appreciate the opportunity! Thank you! Nice challenge.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
